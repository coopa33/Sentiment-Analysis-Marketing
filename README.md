### Sentiment Analysis for Marketing using NLP

This project is my implementation using the outline and data given by [koosha-t](https://github.com/koosha-t/Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-for-Marketting).

The purpose of this project is to learn the Git workflow, as well as familiarizing myself with Data Processing pipelines, and various forms of Sentiment Analysis, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.

Data for the project is obtained via this [link](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) (under 'small subset for experimentation', Video Games 5-core). Data is assumed to be stored within project directory under "data/", which is subject to .gitignore
